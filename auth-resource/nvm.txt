Assignment: Mastering Node Version Management

Assignment: Node Version Manager (NVM) Basics and Usage

Objective:
To demonstrate your understanding of installing, managing, and using multiple versions of Node.js using Node Version Manager (NVM).

Requirements:

NVM Installation:
Install NVM according to your operating system.
Use a terminal or command prompt command to confirm NVM has been successfully installed.

Managing Node Versions with NVM:
List all the available versions of Node.js.
Install the latest stable version of Node.js.
Install another older version of Node.js for testing purposes (e.g., a version from a year ago).
Confirm the installed versions using NVM.
Set one of the installed versions as the default Node version.

Switching Between Node Versions:
Use NVM to switch to the older version you installed.
Confirm the version switch using a terminal command.
Switch back to the latest version and confirm the switch.

Creating a Sample Project:
Initialize a new Node.js project using the npm init command.
Create a simple app.js file that logs the current Node.js version.
Run this file under both Node versions (latest and older) and observe the output.

Uninstalling a Node Version:
Uninstall the older version of Node.js that you previously installed.
Confirm that the version has been removed using NVM.

Updating NVM:
Research how to update NVM to its latest version for your operating system.
Update NVM and confirm the successful update with a terminal command.
